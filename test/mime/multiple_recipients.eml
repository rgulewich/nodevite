Hey all!

Sorry, but this week, I am just a wreck from some very early morning shifts.
 I'm afraid I won't be organizing a breakfast for tomorrow, but please don't
let that stop anyone who is hellbent on some good breakfast.  Recip, I would
highly recommend going to Jethro's if you haven't been already.  It is only
up the road from you, after all.

Hope you all have a great long weekend.  I'll be more on top of things by
mid-next week.  Again, I'm sorry!

The Sender
